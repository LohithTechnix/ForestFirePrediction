ðŸ”§ Tools and Technologies Used
This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline â€” from data preprocessing to model training and web-based deployment â€” using the following tools and technologies:

1. ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing (cleansing_feature_selection.ipynb)
Tools:

pandas and numpy: Data manipulation and cleaning.

matplotlib and seaborn: Data visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

2. ðŸ§  Model Training (model_training.ipynb)
Tools:

scikit-learn: Building machine learning models (e.g., Ridge, ElasticNet).

matplotlib: Model performance visualization.

pickle: Saving the trained model and scaler for later use.

3. ðŸš€ Model Deployment (webapp.py)
Tools:

Flask: Developing the web application for model inference.

scikit-learn: Loading the saved model and scaler.

pandas: Handling user input data.

ðŸ“Œ Summary
This project combines the power of pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and Flask to build a robust machine learning pipeline covering:

âœ… Data Preprocessing

âœ… Model Training

âœ… Model Deployment (Web App)
